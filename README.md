# 2.2 Coins


## Background:
Some cash register systems use change machines that automatically dispense coins. This lab will
investigate the problem solving and programming behind such machinery. You always want to use
the fewest coins possible. You should use integer mathematics to solve this problem.

Provide the number of cents through the constructor. Write a method that calculates the number of
each type of coin.

Examples:

    35 cents:
        Quarter(s) 1
        Dime(s) 1
        Nickel(s) 0
        Penny(s) 0

    41 cents:
        Quarter(s) 1
        Dime(s) 1
        Nickel(s) 1
        Penny(s) 1

## Assignment:
1. Follow the same format that was used in Lab Assignment A3.1, Easter, using a driver and a class
called Coins.
2. Run the samples from above to check your work.
3. Run the following three samples and copy the sample runs into your class file, print out the code
for the class and hand in.
94 cents
59 cents
19 cents
4. Do not worry about singular versus plural endings, i.e. quarter/quarters.
